Emma: Good morning everyone. Let’s start with updates on the onboarding module.
Liam: Sure. We’ve completed the walkthrough flow for new users, but the welcome email logic still needs testing.
Sophia: I tested it last night—emails are firing but the template has alignment issues.
Olivia: I’ll ask the design team to review the email template today.
Emma: Great. Please prioritize it so we can push it to staging by tomorrow.
Noah: Speaking of staging, the backup service failed during last night’s run. I’ll investigate and share a report by noon.
Liam: Was any data lost?
Noah: No, but we need to double-check the auto-recovery mechanism.
Sophia: I’ll coordinate with DevOps on that.
Emma: Please do. Now, about the analytics dashboard—what’s the status?
Olivia: The charts are loading fine, but the filtering isn’t working as expected.
Liam: I’ll debug that after lunch and update the issue ticket.
Emma: Thank you. We also have the partner integration with FinBank due next week.
Noah: Their API sandbox credentials were received yesterday. I’ll start testing the endpoints this afternoon.
Emma: Excellent. Please document anything odd in Postman and share it.
Sophia: Do we need to update the privacy policy due to this integration?
Emma: Yes, good point. Let’s review the policy draft on Thursday.
Liam: I’ll check with Legal and get their feedback by Wednesday.
Olivia: Quick note—the UI team needs a response on the login screen animation concept.
Emma: I saw it. Looks slick but feels heavy. Let’s simplify it.
Noah: I can reduce frame size and re-export it in Lottie format.
Emma: Perfect. Target for Friday?
Noah: Yes, doable.
Sophia: Also, we need to align on the Q3 hiring plan. The data team is understaffed.
Emma: Let’s schedule a 1-hour planning session on Monday.
Olivia: Can we invite HR to that call?
Emma: Absolutely. Include Priya from HR.
Liam: Oh, I almost forgot—Slack notifications for deployments aren’t triggering.
Noah: I’ll check the webhook setup today.
Emma: Thank you. Anything else?
Sophia: Should we reschedule the product demo with TechNova? Their PM was on leave.
Emma: Yes, move it to next Wednesday. Send a calendar update.
Olivia: I’ll handle that.
Emma: Lastly, reminder: performance reviews are due next Friday. Submit yours by EOD Tuesday.
Noah: Got it.
Liam: Acknowledged.
Sophia: Noted.
Olivia: Thanks, Emma.
